### Information & Advice

We ensure that members have access to the latest and most relevant knowledge through:

- Regular sharing of information and industry updates
- Access to valuable documents and resources
- Personalized consulting in person, by phone, or by email

### Assistance with Dispute Resolution

When workplace challenges arise, our team provides impartial support to resolve disputes efficiently and fairly by:

- Facilitating negotiation at the factory level (**only if the customer is freely willing to accept it.**)
- Assisting with conciliation through the Township Conciliation Body
- Supporting preparation of related documents

**Note**: As all of above matters can be involved with confidentiality, we will never push a customer to accept for not losing face like operating a project activity. As far as the customer does not initiate it, we will never touch anything intrusively.

### Training & Development

We are committed to building the capacity of employers, managers, and workers through:

- Free or discounted access to MGMAemp's regular training classes
- In-factory training programs, including:
- Applied labor law training for management teams
- Formation and training of Workplace Coordination Committees (WCC)
- Workers’ orientation programs
- PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) usage training
- Chemical usage training

**Note**: As all of the above except the **regular training classes** are in-factory trainings, we will never push a customer to accept them. As far as the customer does not initiate it, we will never touch anything intrusively.

But MGMAemp's regular training classes are very special for your career of management in manufacturing industries. To become a very competitive HR Manager, CSR Manager or any higher positioned officer in a management office of manufacturing industries, these training classes are exactly for you. We never indoctrinate an ideology or promoting anything under hood. Instead, we do deliver our trainings through valuable documents, insightful and interactive discussions, sharing experiences, and, at the same time, maintaining the principle of PASS as follows:

- **P** - plain
- **A** - authentic
- **S** - straight
- **S** - simple

**For instance**, we will not promote or indoctrinate an ideology of any organization without discussing how they are operating, structured, connected each others, what are their leverages, where does their funding come from, and who is pulling the string behind the incidents, etc.

MGMAemp's regular training classes will help you think **freely, outside the box and critically**.

### Assistance with Social Compliance

To help factories meet compliance requirements and maintain good practices, we provide:

- Guidance on compiling and maintaining documents
- Internal auditing services to identify gaps and strengthen compliance systems
